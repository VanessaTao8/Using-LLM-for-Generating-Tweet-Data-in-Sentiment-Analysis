I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for our child's sake, and he literally stared right through me without saying a word. 3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him he was missing out on the most amazing person in this world, and how it wasn't fair to her. To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her. He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.",0

It was a constant up and down; one minute we were happy and he was being more affectionate than he has in years, the next he's screaming at me and calling me a whore. I get it, I broke him.

6re4iy,He keeps going back to her. He even cleans up the messes she makes when she smashes his stuff. He has dropped all of his dreams because she doesn't approve of them. Sorry for the long post but it sucks hearing that he is in this situation and we just want our friend back so he can recover from this. He used to be the funniest and happiest guy around and now he is just broken.,1
