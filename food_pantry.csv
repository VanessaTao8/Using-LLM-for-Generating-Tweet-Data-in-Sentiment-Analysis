9m6nul,"Hey guys. My girlfriend and I recently made a move from South Florida to Ohio for a change of scenery and a massive cost of living decrease. Due to the unexpected costs of the move and the cost of getting settled into our new home, we are severely in need of some basics to get us and our two pets through until we receive our first full checks from our new jobs. Our original dream was to move across the country to the west coast and start from scratch when we arrived. We had enough for the journey and to get us into a place, but not much else, so we reevaluated our finances and settled down in Ohio instead, about 1500 miles away from our previous home and about halfway to our original destination.",0
