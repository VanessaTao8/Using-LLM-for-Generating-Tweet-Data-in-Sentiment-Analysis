The truth is that when I started going out with my boyfriend I secretly saw my ex a few times to see if I really didn't feel anything for him, but it was disgusting. I didn't even want him to touch me. I feel bad with myself I didn't want him, but still, I was there. Then I kinda realized I felt nothing love related for him and it was ok. HE was HURT when he knew I was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. But now the problem is that when I'm with my boyfriend, I don't feel like I love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, I just feel 'ok' with him, and I catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had, and it drives me crazy because I know that if I see him again I won't feel that way, that 'love' that my mind makes me think stills there. And recently I found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and I got so mad and so hurt (I know I don't have any right to feel that way), I felt betrayed and I STILL feel that way, I gross myself out.",1
