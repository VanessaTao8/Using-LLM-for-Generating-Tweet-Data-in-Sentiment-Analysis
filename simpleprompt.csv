It was so cute when I would try and help her with her bath, and she would say 'no mommy, I need my PRIVATY..LOL. we encouraged this as she got older.",0
My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up. But the anxiety swirls to the point i keep trying to find where i went wrong. It replays and plays in my head over and over like a horror movie. The feeling of wanting to die because at that point i had nothing left.,1
This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put. Sort of if where I was was right I wouldn't be feeling like this is now. I'm not thinking I should leave for the sake of being single to see someone else but maybe if I'm not as happy as I thought I should be leaving for me to have some time and space to do things on my own. Any suggestions reddit? **tl;dr my crush on my driving instructor is making me think about leaving my boyfriend**,1

"Hi, I was recently put on Prozac (10mg to start) for anxiety after a really bad panic attack. I am nervous but also hopeful that this will help me. For the first week I cried at least once a day and usually there was no reason, my anxiety is also heightened but I knew these symptoms would occur so I've been dealing with it fine. But for the past like day and a half I feel like my joints are kind of feeling weird. I wouldn't say it's painful just different.",0
"Really hoping someone might have some insight for me! A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M). We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office. Anyway, we really got along! We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.",0
"I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't need it. Long story short, something's flipped in my head the last couple of weeks and my libido is very much back, worryingly so, I'm not sure what to do with it lol. So we've had more sex in the past 7 days than the preceding 7 years....but it's still very much for him. I don't know what I want and I don't know how to ask for what I want. It's been so freaking long since I considered sex as a thing it actually makes me nervous.",1
"Thanks to my alma mater 👩‍🎓!      I’d like to know Any suggestions from u all on how I might I move on in the  healthiest way possible and carry on with only love in my heart for her? How might I bounce back and focus on forming healthier relationships? Any advice or suggestions are appreciated, guys. Sending positive vibes your way 😇",0
"The $4 cable I usually get fr Dollarama is out of stock, the cheapest I can find is $7 at a different dollar store, but nothing less than $30 at London Drugs and The Source. Here's where it gets complicated: my bank account is in a weird limbo right now and I don't know how much to ask for. My current balance is about $3, but my monthly service charges haven't been applied yet. So I know I'm going to be overdrawn, but the service charge varies depending on how many transactions I did, so I don't know how much I'll be overdrawn.",0
"I apologise for worrying anyone who have loved ones is dyslexic because I should never imply that they are any less important. I'm talking about today, my birthday. While my birthday itself is me just trying to make it through",1
"It was the summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.  I met a girl that was equally odd, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.  We quickly became enamored with each other. It didn't take long for us to move in together.  I started finding projects around the house to fix up, she would surprise me with home cooked meals or a note gushing over our relationship.",0
"I also have no family. I was abused for my disabilities as a child, including murder attempts, so I cannot turn to my family for help. I have friends helping me with food and transportation because I am poor and disability aid is barely enough to eat a meal a day. I have food stamps that work for about a week or week and a half of groceries so that's already really helpful. I live in a small, worn down appartement with no heating and thays why I am so cold.",1
"I'm posting this one more time for anyone that didn't see it. Our location is in central Louisiana. A co-worker recently gave birth last week and her baby is in stable condition. She was initially told that her baby would have dwarfism and she was okay with that, as long as it was healthy. Later, they told her that her baby wouldn't survive at birth.",0
"I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily. I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life. Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it). It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me. they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.",1
"I've been with Mike for 4 years now. We have an amazing relationship and I never felt bothered by anything in it, not even silly arguments that are more than common between a couple. Mike has a best friend named Theo. Theo is a cute guy who never seems to settle down, but not in a womanizer way, more like, he hasn't found the one. Well, hadn't found the one.",0
"and then proceeded to show me the video of the 'dumb girlfriend' struggling to answer the question. Needless to say, I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?",1
Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:,0
I typically would not care in the slightest about things like that but I feel as if since my good friends basically turned their backs on me that I am at a loss? If my good friends did before does that mean everyone else will too? **TLDR: GF and I broke up. She is trying to turn people against me. What can I do?,1
"Her parents supported her. I told her I thought it was a bad idea, that she should finish what she had left (she's an excellent student, super smart and committed) and then go to study the other career. But if she decided to leave I would support her 100%. She decided to quit. The other career was in another town, my home town (<2hs away) she rented an apartment with 2 girls and moved away.",0
"I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't. But I am in trauma therapy for the last four months, and my therapist has brought it up a number of times. She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.",1
If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear. But at least he didn’t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,1
"A little about them... I have a 17 year old, that is biologically my niece. My sister moved out when she was 3 weeks old and I raised her from that point. I was only 16. I have a 12 year old son that is biologically my husbands nephew, but we adopted him.",0

"I apologize for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault. Am I crazy, or do we need to break up?",1
"throwaway because my normal account is a common username for me.... Anyway, I've been in a lesbian relationship for near 7 years. The first 2 was long distance but then i moved from NY to TX to be with her. Everything was generally okay until we moved into a new apartment back in December. It isnt the best but its a roof over our heads and it's relatively cheap.",0
"I felt the tension and the seriousness. Usually during lockdown drills things aren't too serious because we're high schoolers. We mess around because we know nothing is wrong. But this drill was different. We knew we were all okay, that everyone was safe, but the atmosphere was completely different.",0
"I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?",1
"I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
"I have replaced my bank card and everything else is canceled, but still haven't went to get a replacement license (another expense I don't really want to think of right now), so I am unable to get one of those free government phones. I am more than willing to repay you in any payment plan you come up with and I can put repayment to you as my second to top priority (I really need some new socks - they get priority, trust me on this, they took my socks and I'm on day 3). Anyway PM of you have any questions. I would be able to take PayPal, Cash App (I no longer have the card but can transfer to bank), a Kroger/Fry's egiftcard or an old T-Mobile phone / unlocked one if someone is local (around <location> ) and wants to meet up even after hearing about my socks. I do have a police report number if anyone needed to verify.",0
"He has been my best friend since the first day we met, he treats me great, he is always loving, not at all selfish, etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, it’s  not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.",1
"I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",0
"He came to the door, drunk and high on opiates (he’s an ex H addict, opiate rage is real), he told me, verbatim, that if there was a guy in the house, he’d kill him on the spot, no questions asked. That was a pretty easy night. I’ve spent countless nights barricaded in my bedroom because of his rage. His past is terrible. Grew up in gangs (Mexican Mafia) and molested at a young age.",1

"Sometimes I am genuinely amused by this subreddit. On smartphones you don’t see peoples age or gender and every time someone writes something stupid all you have to do is read the first 5 lines of their bio and you can be sure it's a 18 year old male (most of the time). All the time a woman writes long, serious sentiments about a subject you search their bio and you can tell it's a 13 year old.",0

I have this massive complex about incumbent Senators needing to die off to get progressive policy passed. It's been here since September. Dying senators is literally all I think about now.,1
I feel like my chest is slowly but firmly being crushed and my hands are shaking. It makes me feel queasy and absolutely fucking fantastic!,1

"I saw an excited dad take his son on a shared daddy son day flight in little turbo prop, the kind used for sightseeing but also for a commute to and from the island.",0
"My Mother would cut her friends hair and mine too. She was a beautician so it saved a bunch. She cut all our hair every 4-6 weeks. My haircut on 6th grade was the last straw. Afterwards, I kept it pixie short for seven years!",0
"Because their old friend simply moved out of our shared house in the middle of the night. Left her cleaning dishes, some plates, and a sink filled with uncovered rotting cat food.",0
"She is fisted her and is forcing her to press pause on her sobbing to let her know, on the down beat from crushing from the loss she feels right now. Making sure that she's being put through so much more than my friend and I had in our respective lifetimes in the first place.",0
This is really when my paranoia and jumpiness are at their highest. I have enough conservative people just wanting to keep it for no reason.,1
I consistently feel like I am on the verge of tears. The youngest Royal children are symbol of hope.,1
I am teetering on the edge of a tantrum. Prominent feminists are scary terrified of my very existence.,1
"Today, everyone lingered in vigil to watch an incredible and intimate wedding. The positioning seemed weird. The couple were standing, and everyone was just crouched around them, looking directly at them staring, not saying anything.",0
"At its core, getting rid of your belongings is peaceful. I started LoL and it's been about 2 months since I have started sorting my stuff.",0
"It is really distressing when a journey. It's hard because everything I see, touch, and talk about is brutalizing me. It just shows how fucking weak I really am.",1
"The cat was returned home, dropped off in the evening in our driveway. We provided a care package out of gratitude. We gave her a dog bed, a blanket I knitted around the cushion from an old patio chair to make it squishy, a cat carrier, a few cans of food, and a home made first aid kit.",0
I have rekindled my passion and feel a renewed interest in life. The book Women Who Run With Wolves helped me rekindle that peace within.,0
When I ignore the feeling it doesn't go away. I've been smacked in the face repeatedly with the same bad memories of things and I just can't take it anymore.,1
Twenty-four hours ago I was advised that I shouldn't have expected another outcome. Fucking kill me.,1
I feel so much more adept at managing it. I began practicing a couple months ago and I can do some pretty cool things now.,0

"One of my best friends is getting married in a few months and found the dress she's been waiting for but can't afford it.

"Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.",0
"These weren't the only punishments, though. Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told. Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself. Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.",0

Im 13 years old and except for school i never go outside i usually spend the whole day on the computer just watching videos on youtube and stuff but at the end of the day i get depressed and feel like i'm wasting my life. I have friends but i also have severe social anxiety and i always feel as if my friends are just putting up with me. I feel depressed and lonely. I never spend time with friends and when i do i feel as if they don't want to hang out with me as we never do anything pls reply if i'm not alone,1
My chest has a different feeling. Before it would feel on fire and chaotic. Now it feels just wrong. Like I am in medical danger. I am a 26 year old woman.,1
"I've been with Mike for 4 years now. We have an amazing relationship and I never felt bothered by anything in it, not even silly arguments that are more than common between a couple. Mike has a best friend named Theo. Theo is a cute guy who never seems to settle down, but not in a womanizer way, more like, he hasn't found the one. Well, hadn't found the one.",0
He keeps going back to her. He even cleans up the messes she makes when she smashes his stuff. He has dropped all of his dreams because she doesn't approve of them. Sorry for the long post but it sucks hearing that he is in this situation and we just want our friend back so he can recover from this. He used to be the funniest and happiest guy around and now he is just broken.,1
"My Father has been struggling with alcoholism for nearly his entire life, he hasn’t been in contact with myself, my mom, or my sister in years. I guess it all of sudden caught up with him, he past away from a heart attack recently. It still doesn’t feel real, but my girlfriends family has been nothing but supportive throughout the whole thing and helped me grieve through his death. Needless to say, I do not want to attend a funeral or memorial, because I’d like to remember the good times I had with him and not being up bad memories. I had a rough child hood, he cheated on my mother, he wasn’t a great guy.",1
"I know there are a lot of bad stories on here about therapy. But I was wondering about good experiences. My own experience was six weeks ago. I slipped and went on s bender, I fell into a depressive, suicidal crisis. I phoned every crisis line that exists, for ten hours, well getting drunker and drunker.",1
I will stay with the sub to offer any advice I can but thought a success story was worthy to share. They say never destroy a person's hope. It may be all they have left. Much love to you all for the good tips and advice during my struggle. Thanks!,0
"I cant do a push up. My arms are almost useless. I need to get surgery, but my parents aren't exactly in the picture and can't support me while I take time off of work to get the surgery. Would I be able to qualify for disability to be able to support myself so that I can get surgery? if not, what kind of options do I have?",0
"Like the title says, I’m rapidly losing motivation. I recently switched collages to be closer to home, so I could be closer to family. And my depressive spirals are coming more often, mainly because of the lack of work I do. I always end up doing things at the last damn minute. My freshman year I tried my best, almost.",1
"I barely slept in the hospital because I stayed up at night and listened for codes with his room number. I was terrified, constantly living in fear from the moment I awoke until about his 7th day in the hospital when he seemed clearer, and sat up with assistance for the first time. Fast forward to now. We are lucky to be alive, and we are injured. We’ve been robbed of a normal engagement, of the experience of moving in together, and that’s a grieving process...but my mind...is not what it was.",1
"These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work. To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds.",0

"After meeting last year, Amanda and Isaac became incredibly close and agreed to live together for their Senior year. This past November, Amanda got drunk at a party and ended up making out with a random guy (on Jeff's birthday). Because of this, Amanda told Jeff that she wanted to take a break. Lots of drama. Everyone was shocked because from the outside, Amanda and Jeff seemed to have a really strong relationship (dating for 4+ years).",0
Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety. If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey. I am unemployed and looking for employment. I live with my grandparents. I'm a 28 year old male.,1

"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1
"I'm leaning more toward not responding but I haven't been able to let it go. I'm not sure what she even wanted, other than to talk to me before make a big decision for and her kids. I got a message pleading for a conversation, no explanation as to what. She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems. She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.",0
"He also said that Brian's mother made comments like she hopes she gets hit by a bus and she's so depressed because I'm doing this to her. (No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.) The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter. The fact that we're withholding her from their toxic behavior right now might be a turning point for him to grow a pair in his own marriage. I'm not holding my breath, but I have a little bit of hope.",0
"I kept begging that person to leave me alone, and somebody else found me a little while later and tried to intervene. I wasn't speaking, but the person was not giving up it's hold on my robe. After struggling a minute or two, I screamed about ""If this veil breaks, I'm going"" and threw my arms up, and my robe came off - the person dropped my robe and scrambled down the hill. In some ways I appreciated that this other person existed in the world and wasn't consumed by horror, as I was. In other ways I resented having to address this traumatic experience and the person who perpetrated it, when I was just trying to enjoy my night.",1

"I have to say I love when my past hauntings show up online, asking me questions. That was a bright spot in an otherwise down evening. I was at a campfire with no tent and it was raining; I was with a close friend who  has been too sick to use their body while in the care of people who are drug addicts, so they were really cold and miserable. I was sharing my umbrella with them to keep some of this rain off them, and keeping the fire going.",0

"As the years went by the town labelled them as high school sweethearts, and every teenager envied their relationship. Everywhere she went, he followed. Every sport he played, she cheered. Through rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine she was in the stands proudly cheering him on. In their own little world they were in love.",0
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1
"Mom had a fight in 2014 with N stepdad and we were kicked out of his house. She came back from work, we packed our bags and we left. He spat in our faces and called us names. A neighbour who is no longer alive saw us on the street and took us in. Her daughter used to babysit me and we used to take the bus together. Now, mom is being persued by a new psycho.",0
"My boyfriend and I generally have a good relationship. We've lived together for about a year and a half, and we have a pretty good partnership going. He's the first guy I've been with who is willing to sit down and really hash things out if we're having an issue. However there is one topic he *won't* hash out with me, and that's that sometimes he asks me questions out of no where that to me feel kind of like little ""pop quizzes"" that I feel are designed to try to catch me off guard and stump me. He'll randomly pose a riddle or ask a logic question, then I kind of fumble because I feel like I have to come up with an answer quickly, or I just get exasperated and tell him I'm not in the mood for a pop quiz.",1
"He also said that he didn't want me to tell my mom, but it was too late; I already had. My mom even asked me if I wanted to talk to the police. He was harassing me for a few weeks and was even following me in his car when I went to apply for college. I am now 18 and am too proud of myself for not getting back with him!",0

"I am 25 years old, suffered from anxiety for about 10 years or so. Anxiety used to stop me from being able to leave the house unless with my parents or boyfriend. I was bullied a lot, and I didn't attend school much and didn't take my GCSE's because of this. I was 90% 'cured' in late 2015/early 2016 by my therapist. I had received help from a therapist once before, but it wasn't helpful to me.",0
They were too caught up in their anger. My grandmother would tell me stories about having to be the one that cleaned the blood from the walls. She thought I might be mentally handicapped because I wouldn't make a sound when all of this was going on. My brother was three years older than I was. My mother left my father when I was two.,0
"Both of these were poor choices. It just exacerbated the situation. I had vases, game controllers, tv remote, coffee mugs, etc thrown at me on varied encounters. This is not an exaggerated list..  I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body, threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.",1
"One anxiety free day. I feel like I could live off that high for the rest of my life. Not starting my day off trying to catch my breath. Not having to plan out every single minute of my day as to avoid discomfort, or even panic. Not standing in the middle of a locker room getting ready to cry because you saw a lock on the locker you use every time you're at the gym.",0
"So what I am asking is someone or somebody's to help me with the rest of the repair cost. The repair is 575 dollars, I have about 200 of that currently, I need to get this done soon before I am stuck on the side of the road with a broken down vehicle and spending unnecessary money on Ubers or Lyft. I'm willing to pay back monthly with acceptable interest until it's paid in full. I get paid bi-weekly at my full time job. Thanks in advance!",1
"Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest. This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year. He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell. After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back. He treated me like a dog.",1
"But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.",1
"Hey guys, I'm not homeless myself, I'm just after some advice. Basically, I work in a restaurant that closes late so I'm often not back to my apartment complex until around midnight. For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway. However I could understand if others in my complex would be distressed or anxious by this, especially if they live on the first floor (I'm fortunate to live higher up on the fourth floor).",0
"But 19 and 39? to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....  I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".  What are people's thoughts on this?   ---",0
"I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe. I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking. But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me. I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise. Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1
"She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him.",0
12. End of January I just didn't have any way to get enough money and we collapse with an eviction process started. 13. Working with friends and others we managed to get the money right after the judgment was issued for eviction. This stopped the eviction but we still had a judgment.,1
"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
"This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.",1
I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1

Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing.

"When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1
But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work.,0
"I wouldn't say I'm a generally anxious person, but I have severe anxiety when it comes to my living space. I've lived alone in various apartments for a few years now, and I don't ever let people come over. I'm pretty messy, but not anything extreme enough to justify keeping people away. My boyfriend has only been over a handful of times and I do my best to rush him out. I'll go out of my way to keep people out.",0

I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now.

I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.,1
He resents how I was raised. He seems to think that my mother telling me to suck it up and keep to myself was better than someone there whenever I call needed.

"But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day.",1

Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma. Starting out the session was definitely very strange. I wasn’t sure what answers my therapist was looking for but once she assured me that there were no wrong answers everything went fine.,0

He comes and gives me hugs when I come home and barely notices when my wife is gone or comes home. - ‎This is also something she's recently admitted and I feel guilty about it, but I feel like it's because she puts in no effort beyond what she needs to do.",1
"She didn't go home with me, she took an Uber. It was the worst 30 minutes of my life. I payed for the food, got it to go, and went home. This is where it gets crazy. I wanted to be away from her at that time.",1

In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago.

He plead guilty to Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, avoided federal charges but was put on the sex offender registry in that state. I just found out that he died in March of this year. Stage 4 cancer.

Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day. ",1

Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear.

After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects.

We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months.

Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies...

Lots of jobs for the world-class unemployed. I'd kind of spectated and gone home, logically thinking about the airport if nothing seemed feasible. I did not have the gas money......",1
I'm freaking out. It's like my mind is starting to implode and I can't control it. Help!,1
I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly. I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like “yeah I can do it” I feel beyond tense. Anyone been in a similar spot? What did you end up doing? Thanks!,1
"What if in Ireland a place existed where pollution was zero, crime didn't exist and you where given access to food, warm beds and a chance to rebuild your life. Would you take it? I'm sick of the city, I'm considering a rural life of self sustainability and have adequate means for finding financing to a farm of some sort. Would a homeless scholarship program work for people? Self sustainable life with access to counselling and all food and board paid for help?",0
"One anxiety free day. I feel like I could live off that high for the rest of my life. Not starting my day off trying to catch my breath. Not having to plan out every single minute of my day as to avoid discomfort, or even panic. Not standing in the middle of a locker room getting ready to cry because you saw a lock on the locker you use every time you're at the gym.",0
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1
"I don't want to leave my house because I know that everyone knows what she's saying about me and EVERYONE BELIEVES IT. this was all over the fact I blocked her because she was toxic. I'm losing it, Reddit. I'm losing my mind. I can't stop crying i can't eat, all I've been thinking about is killing myself.",1
"So what I am asking is someone or somebody's to help me with the rest of the repair cost. The repair is 575 dollars, I have about 200 of that currently, I need to get this done soon before I am stuck on the side of the road with a broken down vehicle and spending unnecessary money on Ubers or Lyft. I'm willing to pay back monthly with acceptable interest until it's paid in full. I get paid bi-weekly at my full time job. Thanks in advance!",1
"Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest. This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year. He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell. After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back. He treated me like a dog.",1
"But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.",1
"Hey guys, I'm not homeless myself, I'm just after some advice. Basically, I work in a restaurant that closes late so I'm often not back to my apartment complex until around midnight. For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway. However I could understand if others in my complex would be distressed or anxious by this, especially if they live on the first floor (I'm fortunate to live higher up on the fourth floor).",0
"But 19 and 39? to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....  I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".  What are people's thoughts on this?   ---",0
"I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe. I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking. But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me. I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise. Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1
"She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him.",0
12. End of January I just didn't have any way to get enough money and we collapse with an eviction process started. 13. Working with friends and others we managed to get the money right after the judgement was issues for eviction. This stopped the eviction but we still had a judgement.,1
"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
"This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.",1
I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1

"Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.",1
"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1
"People may quickly think ""drugs"" but just try and quickly think ""animals"" unless you are dangerous when you have your episodes or become angry after them. Just think that all of that drug money some people spend could go on raising and giving a loving home to an animal who will heal him/her. x &#x200B; &#x200B;",0
"When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1

"I've never had a problem playing a rogue, however I've recently started a new campaign and my DM has decided to make starting equipment a thing this time around. I've never thought about it before but I started thinking today and I realised that starting equipment is so bloody important for rogues.

Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore. Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.",0
"This is marriage #2 for both of us. Husband's (52 M) ex (51 F) cheated, my ex (53 M) had emotional affair, leading to ending marriages in the same year. We dated in high school, and reconnected as friends, started dating about a year later, moved in together after a year, got engaged 2 years after that. Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer, found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.",1
"I’m struggling with anxiety a lot lately and just wanted to get it off my chest. I should be so lucky to live my life, but every time it's quiet and I don't have something to do or some kind of white noise all I can think of reasonings and justifications on why I’m more important than other people. I’m going out of my mind with frustration. Struggling shielded, by everyone else's expectations that I have chosen to elect in and live through it.",1
"I'm 24f, from a small town in California. Since April, I’ve been living at a remote ranger station in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.

"I'm going to try to break this down quickly to make sense of it and if not, perhaps someone can give me a line on how to examine this. I think, 'I can't believe how many of the things they tell us we don't have over here or the sort that we don't have at all', and 'it feels like the only those states that are known for being the highest trouble in the country have even known what the standards are (like my state has commercial grade flour, that's should be something from home').",1
